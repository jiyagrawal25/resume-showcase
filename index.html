            <p>A passionate and dedicated student, seeking for a challenging position in an organization where I can learn new skills, expand my knowledge and leverage my learning. Throughout my academic journey, I have been deeply interested in solving complex problems through technology and developing innovative solutions that have practical applications. My coursework and project experiences have allowed me to work extensively with web development, data analysis, and predictive modeling. Notably, I have developed a machine learning-based diabetes prediction model and a web-based system aimed at improving healthcare data management. These projects have strengthened my ability to work with structured data, optimize algorithms, and create user-friendly applications.

            Beyond academics, I am keen on staying updated with emerging technologies and continuously expanding my technical expertise through hands-on projects and independent learning.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>1. Currently, I am developing a machine learning model for diabetes prediction, focusing on improving accuracy and reliability. This project involves extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering to enhance the dataset’s quality. I am also implementing various feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant attributes that influence diabetes prediction. Through this project, I am gaining hands-on experience in data science methodologies, model optimization, and performance evaluation.</p>
            <p>2. I developed a tourism website showcasing the rich cultural heritage and historical significance of Jaipur city. The project aimed to provide an interactive and user-friendly platform for travelers to explore Jaipur’s iconic landmarks, including Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal, City Palace, and Jantar Mantar. The website featured detailed descriptions, high-quality images, and an intuitive navigation system to enhance user experience. </p>
